I mostly use my own GitLab Server because most of my personal projects are monetized :)

#### Tango: LLM-guided Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generation and DPO-based Alignment [![Tango](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-gray?style=flat&logo=GitHub&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/declare-lab/tango)

</p>

üéµ üî• üéâ üéâ We are releasing Tango 2 built upon Tango for text-to-audio generation. Tango 2 was initialized with the Tango-full-ft checkpoint and underwent alignment training using DPO on audio-alpaca, a pairwise text-to-audio preference dataset. [Download the model](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/tango2), [Access the demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/declare-lab/tango2). [Trainer is available in the tango2 directory](https://github.com/declare-lab/tango/tree/master/tango2)üé∂

## Description

**TANGO** is a latent diffusion model (LDM) for text-to-audio (TTA) generation. **TANGO** can generate realistic audios including human sounds, animal sounds, natural and artificial sounds and sound effects from textual prompts. We use the frozen instruction-tuned LLM Flan-T5 as the text encoder and train a UNet based diffusion model for audio generation. We perform comparably to current state-of-the-art models for TTA across both objective and subjective metrics, despite training the LDM on a 63 times smaller dataset. We release our model, training, inference code, and pre-trained checkpoints for the research community.
